# Testing Coverage

Testing criteria for a passing coverage requirement:

- Line coverage of 80%
- Cognitive complexity of 0
- Have cognitive complexity < 5, but have any coverage

Low cognitive complexity means there are few conditional branches to cover. Tests with cognitive complexity 0 would be covered by invocation.
